# Amazon GameLift Servers SDK for Unreal Engine

The Amazon GameLift Servers SDK for Unreal Engine is compatible with UE5 versions (5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5), and supports development and packaging of game servers for Windows or Linux, as well as game clients for any Unreal-supported platform.
The SDK supports both x64 and ARM architectures, with ARM architecture being supported starting from Unreal Engine version 5.0 and above.

## Install the SDK for Unreal Engine

Follow these steps to set up the SDK for Unreal Engine and add it to your Unreal Engine editor.

### Step 1: Install prerequisites

You’ll need the following tools to install and run the plugin with your Unreal projects.

* An AWS account to use with Amazon GameLift Servers. To use the plugin guided workflows, you need a user profile with your AWS account and access credentials. See [Set up an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/setting-up-aws-login.html) for help with these steps:
    * Sign up for an AWS account.
    * Create a user with permissions to use Amazon GameLift Servers.
    * Set up programmatic access with long-term IAM credentials.
* A source-built version of the Unreal Engine editor. You need a source-built editor to package a multiplayer game server build. See these Unreal Engine documentation topics:
    * [Accessing Unreal Engine source code on GitHub](https://www.unrealengine.com/ue-on-github) (requires GitHub and Epic Games accounts).
    * [Building Unreal Engine from Source](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/building-unreal-engine-from-source/)
* A multiplayer game project with C++ game code. (Blueprint-only projects aren’t compatible with the plugin.) If you don’t have a project in progress, use one of the Unreal Engine sample games such as the [Third Person Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/third-person-template-in-unreal-engine).
If you're starting a new Unreal project, create a game using the Third Person template and use the following settings:
    * C++
    * With starter content
    * Desktop
    * Custom project name (examples in this README use the name `GameLiftUnrealApp`)
* [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) 2019 or newer.
* [Unreal Engine cross-compiling toolchain](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/linux-development-requirements-for-unreal-engine#cross-compiletoolchain). This tool is required only if you’re building a Linux game server.

### Step 2: Get the plugin

1. Download the plugin `GameLift-Cpp-ServerSDK-UnrealPlugin-<version>.zip` from the repository’s [**Releases**](https://github.com/amazon-gamelift/amazon-gamelift-plugin-unreal/releases) page or clone the repository if you plan to customize it.
2. If you downloaded the plugin from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/amazon-gamelift/amazon-gamelift-plugin-unreal/releases) page, unzip the downloaded file `GameLift-Cpp-ServerSDK-UnrealPlugin-<version>.zip`. 
3. If you cloned the repository, run the following command in the root directory of the repository:
   
    For Linux or Max:
    ```sh
    chmod +x setup.sh
    sh setup.sh
    ```

   For Windows:
    ```
    powershell -file setup.ps1
    ```

    Once completed, the plugin is ready to be added to an Unreal game project.

### Step 3: Add the plugin to your Unreal game project
1. Locate the root folder of your Unreal game project. Look for a subfolder named `Plugins`. If it doesn’t exist, create it.
2. Copy the entire `GameLiftServerSDK/` folder, either from this repository (after running the setup script) or from the unzipped release bundle, into the `Plugins` folder in your game project.
3. Open the `.uproject` file for your game project. Add the `GameLiftServerSDK` to the `Plugins` section:
    ```
    "Plugins": [
        ......
        {
            "Name": "GameLiftServerSDK",
            "Enabled": true
        }
    ]
    ```
4. In a file browser, select the game project `.uproject` file and choose the option **Switch Unreal Engine Version**. Set the game project to use the source-built Unreal Editor (as mentioned in Step 1).
5. (Windows) In the game project root folder, right-click the `.uproject` file and choose the option to generate project files. Open the solution ( `*.sln`) file and build or rebuild the project.


## Next steps: Integrate your game server and deploy for hosting

After you add the server SDK to your game project, see these Amazon GameLift Servers documentation topics for help with integrating your game code and preparing your game server to work with Amazon GameLift Servers.

## Troubleshoot plugin installation

#### Issue: When rebuilding the game project’s solution file after adding the plugin, I get some compile errors.

**Resolution:** Add the following line to your `<ProjectName>Editor.Target.cs` file to disable adaptive unity build, which may cause conflicts:
```
    bUseAdaptiveUnityBuild = false;
```
